My name is Daniel Wilson and I am a developer, designer, and musician from Traverse City, MI currently living in Ann Arbor studying **Computer Science** at the **University of Michigan**.

![Me and the Family]()

There's not a lot of things I don't like to do, but to you'll most likely find me beatboxing, dancing, or drumming on something that shouldn't be drummed on. With an **Unofficial Minor in Freestyle Rap** I would say I enjoy all things musical.

##Hobbies

I am currently apart of [Groove Percussion Group](http://umuac.org/groove/),
