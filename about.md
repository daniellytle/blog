**What's there to know about me?** Well, I love the web, I love code, I love colors, I love layouts and I love how people interact with all of them. That's a lot of loves you say? Well, I am a passionate guy.

Technically speaking, I a 6'5" web developer from Traverse City, MI who wants to change the world through technology. I am constantly developing projects on my own and with others while I study Computer Science at the University of Michigan.

I believe that anyone can code, and like my mothers cooking, everyone should at least **try it**. I write this blog in hopes of helping, encouraging, and maybe inspiring those making there way down the path I took.
