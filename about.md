**What's there to know about me?** Well, I love the web, I love code, I love colors, I love layouts, and I love how people interact with all of them. That's a lot of loves you say? Well, I am a passionate guy.

Technically speaking, I a 6'5" web developer from [Traverse City, MI](http://traversecity.com) who wants to change the world through technology. I am constantly developing projects on my own and with others while I study Computer Science at the [University of Michigan](http://umich.edu).

I believe that anyone can code, and like [Settlers of Catan](http://catan.com), everyone should at least **try it**. I write this [Blog](http://daniellytle.github.io/blog) in hopes of helping, encouraging, and maybe inspiring those making there way down the path I took. 

##Organizations

[Groove Percussion Group](http://umuac.org/groove/), a very diverse musical group on campus that specializes in drumming on anything and everything. Come see our show in the spring!

[Kappa Theta Pi](http://kappathetapi.com), the world's first ever **Professional Technology Fraternity**. It's full of talented developers, designers, and young professionals who will surely change the world.

##Hobbies

**Music** - I love finding unique musicians from far off places and sharing there music with my friends. Check out my [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com/danielwilsonmusic)!

**Hackathons** - Gotta love that "We'll do it live" mentality while working through the night until **It just works**. Regular attendee of [MHacks](http://mhacks.org).

**Water** - Growing up with lakes everywhere I've always loved being on the water.

##Disclaimer

I do not pretend to be the smartest guy in the world so if you see a flaw in a post by all means let me know (even if you wanna just discuss it). I love learning more about cool stuff!

I truly hope you enjoy your time here in our little corner of the web! All the best!
