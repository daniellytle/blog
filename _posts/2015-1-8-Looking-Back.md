**2014 was an incredible year**. I am very thankful the incredible things I've been able to enjoy. Attending the University of Michigan, I have met many inspirational people and would value what I have learned from them as greater than my coursework. I love the mentality that everyone has pieces of wisdom from their life experiences and if you can keep and open mind and really listen to what they have to say, you can become the best version of yourself. 

In my time at Michigan, the world has become so much larger but at the same time smaller.
