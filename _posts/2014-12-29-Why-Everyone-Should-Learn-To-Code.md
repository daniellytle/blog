title: Why Everyone Should Learn to Code

Before I came to Michigan, I had never written a line of code. I can still remember the first lab of my intro to programming course freshman year. I was confused, frustrated, and felt like everyone there was smarter than I. For myself, this was the greatest difficulty in my computer science career, starting.

But after sticking it out, I found coding to be interesting, fun, and useful. The first **non-"Hello World"** program I wrote was a trajectory calculator. I remember looking at it with pride thinking, wow I made this, imagine what else you could make with lines of code? The answer is anything.

The moment I realized this simple fact my world changed. The ultimate goal of "Changing the World" suddenly seemed a lot more doable. 

##Learning to Learn

My favorite part of the Software Development field/area/space is how open and accessable everything is. The expanse of information on all **Stack Exchange** sites is astounding. I would wager if you're an average developer with a problem, there is a 80% chance your solution is somewhere on **Stack Overflow**. 

Technology in general is a fast moving edge and to stay relevent one must be constantly learning. 

##Things I've Learned

My father taught me the lesson that no matter what you do or how hard you work, there will always be someone better than you, and that's perfectly fine. Especially at an awesome school like Michigan. There are kids in my classes who could code circles around me and I accept that. 

##Conclusion

I believe the computer science mindset can change the way you view life and inspire you to work harder to make the world a better place. If your completely new and want to try it out, check out some of the links below to get started.
