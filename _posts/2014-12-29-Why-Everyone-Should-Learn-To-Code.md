I had never coded in high school and looking back I really wish I would've had exposure to programming then, not just to get a head start on development in general but to have the **non-technical skills** coding has taught me.

##Learning to Learn

Technology in general is a fast moving edge and to stay relevent one must be constantly learning. 

##Things I've Learned

My father taught me the lesson that no matter what you do or how hard you work, there will always be someone better than you, and that's perfectly fine. Especially at an awesome school like Michigan. There are kids in my classes who could code circles around me and I accept that. 

##Conclusion

I believe the computer science mindset can change the way you view life and inspire you to work harder to make the world a better place. If your completely new and want to try it out, check out some of the links below to get started.
