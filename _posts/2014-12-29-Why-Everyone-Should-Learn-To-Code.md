##My Story

Before I came to Michigan, I had never written a line of code. I can still remember the first lab of my intro to programming course freshman year. I was confused, frustrated, and felt like everyone there was smarter than I. For myself, this was the greatest difficulty in my computer science career, starting.

##Things I've Learned
