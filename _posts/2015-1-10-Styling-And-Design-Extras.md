**There exist some incredible tools to assist web developers**. I will go over some of the tools that have helped me the most in my quest to make beautiful web things.

##Development tools

[JsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net) is an awesome development sandbox that allows you to mess around with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript easily. It's great for experimenting and isolating certain features you want.

**Google Developer Tools** is that weird thing that pops up when you click "inspect element" that is also every developers best friend. 

##Typography

[Google Fonts](http://google.com/fonts) is a great place to get beautiful free fonts for your site. Just follow their easy steps and you'll have unique typography in no time.

##Colors and Textures

[Adobe Kuler](https://color.adobe.com/explore/most-popular/?time=all) is great for finding and managing color schemes for your site. You can create your own or use some popular schemes.
