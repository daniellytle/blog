**This past weekend, the nations best and brightest young hackers came to The University of Michigan to attend MHacks**, one of the biggest Hackathons in the world. It was 36 straight hours of building, coding, and maybe some testing thrown in there. 

This was not however, a dimly lit room full of nerds furiously typing at laptops. MHacks is like a Tech Carnival. Booths of hot new tech companies with dazzling displays of free swag lined the halls, Spontaneous snowball fights erupted outside, and there was always a ping-pong tournament to participate in.

The past few years I've had the pleasure of attending MHacks, I was the kid chugging RedBull jamming my face into a laptop most of the weekend. This year I took a more mature approach and while still getting to work hard on a project, I was able to maintain a somewhat healthy lifestyle. I am a huge proponent of the *Healthy Hacker Lifestyle* where one can get a good amount of sleep and food, while still putting a lot into a project. On the other hand, if you're just cranking out something, by all means go ahead.

One of the stars of the show at MHacks was the **Meta Glasses**, and augmented reality device with an SDK which allowed students to make some incredible things. At one point I was watching one kid feed his friend virtual onions. Many other cool development platforms were available: Google Glass, Oculus Rift, Mio Armband to name a few.

All in all, I got to spend good time with friends, meet new people, and learn and develop my personal skills. A lot of friends from Kappa Theta Pi, all posted up together on the outskirts of the MHacks campus to enjoy a more chill experience. It's always a fun adventure and I can't wait until the next one!
