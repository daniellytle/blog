**As I sit in the Detroit Airport looking out at the giant shnoz of an airplane, I'm just grateful I'm inside**. It's Presidents Day and the current temperature is 10 degrees. This morning it was -20. I haven't been on a plane since I was very little and it's been a very interesting experience so far. Arriving three hours before my flight I've had plenty of time to kill. So far I've walked the length of the terminal and gotten some snacks. It's gone surprisingly well so far, haven't been tackled by TSA or lost any of my super important documents(yet).

Now I'm enveloped in the classic airport ritual of waiting. As air travel is such a fast moving machine It makes sense to have some padding time in case logistics change. As I wrote that last sentence, a flight to Charlotte was canceled and it would seem that people are not happy about it. One thing I have to note is the number of travel hockey team players in this airport. I would wager that nearly 40% of all the people currently in the airport have some sort of affiliation to a travel hockey team. You'd have thought they bought out the whole place for a banquet or something.

Flying is incredible. On take off it seems that each pilot pushes his or her plane to max-speed, to impress other pilots. We just took off from Phoenix en route to San Francisco. On my flight from Detroit I met a incredible girl named Amy. She was a Jazz Pianist from Los Angeles visiting a friend for Valentines Day. It was really cool to hear what she had to say about being a professional musician, casual surfer, and so called "domestic sciences". To her, domestic sciences was the art of her building everyday solutions from their base ingredients. She would make her own spaghetti, as well as laundry ditergint, from scratch. This was incredible to hear, especially from as a college student who spends as little time possible preparing food. Regardless, I'm glad I met her!

Tomorrow I start work on my **Fun Mystery Project** at Weebly. I am excited as well as nervous and at the same time totally thrilled to be given this experience and I can't wait to meet the team. They have been extremely accomodating for me so I am anxious to thank them in person for their generousity. Time for a quick side bar.

The most amazing part of flying is the view, not the view of natures wide expanse but more the scope of what you can see. Cities, full of people each with their own goals, dreams, and passions. Amazing is an understatement. I have been lucky enough to have window seats on both my flights so far. Currently it is #000 outside so I'm bummed I can't see the earths features but I look forward to the ride home in the daytime.

I feel silly for not having brought a book. I could be absorbing tasteful literature right now but instead I am producing this cheese.

##San Francisco

I got in pretty late. This was not ideal as I would start work the next day. The hotel room Weebly had gotten me was absurdly swank. Right in downtown, this hotel also had a 1600's themed doorman who would chill on the street and greet people.

I think I walked around the block before checking in. The exciting energy that San Francisco gives off really hit me immediately. It's all true about San Francisco, Palm Trees, Trolley Cars, and hills, they were all there.
