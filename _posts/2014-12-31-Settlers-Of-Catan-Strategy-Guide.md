For a brief intro, Settlers of Catan is a very popular board game. In this post I will go over some lessons I have learned from playing the game and strategies I employ.

#Styles of Play

In my mind, there are a few roles you can play in the game that give you a good chance of winning. If you solidify yourself as this player early, players will not contest you for it.

####Development Card Guy

"Dev Cards" can change a game in the blink of an eye. From moving to robber to straight up winning the game. If you establish yourself as the guy whose gonna go for Dev Cards first, you most likely will pick up **biggest army** and a few **Victory Points** aswell. A great asset of this strategy is your ability to conceal your Dev Cards and pull of some game changing suprises. 

####Longest Road Guy

You want to expand your kingdom to the reaches of the earth and that's cool. While this strategy can be costly resource wise, you can set your self up for a great second half of the game. Having an extremely long road not only gives you the two pointes for longest road but it gives you a lot of space for settlments which can give you access to precious resources you had to barter for in the beginning. 

####Port Trading Guy

With a high frequency resource next to a 2:1 port of the corresponding type, you can build quite the trade post enabling you to get a diverse array of resources early in the game.
