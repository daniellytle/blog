For a brief intro, Settlers of Catan is a very popular board game. In this post I will go over some lessons I have learned from playing the game and strategies I employ.

#Critical Points

###Picking you Inital Settlements

The best thing you can do in the beginning is maximize the good and minimize the bad. Getting boxed in early will make your chances muy mal so try to spread your settlments out in an effort to claim a part of the board or enable you sort of "fill in the line" between the two and snag longest road first.

In terms of role numbers, it's can be benifitial to find a nice range of numbers rather than a high probability jackpot. This will give you a more consistent stream of resources rather than a massive payout after 7 years of drought. 

If you can solidify yourself as the source of one essential resource, all the other players will be at your mercy. Basically, the "Brick Guy" determines the rate at which the game progresses. I guess if you can **Monopolize** a single resource, go for it!

###Diversify your Play

While it's good to play a strategy, a balance of all game elements can be essential. I try to follow some of these helpful tips.

**Build at least four Settlements** - This is key when the board becomes locked up and your best hope for points is building cities. These are points you can count on compared to depending on Dev Card points or fighting someone for longest road.

**Always have a Knight ready** - If your having success due to a certain tile, the players will most likely mob you in an effort to shut down your imports and it can be a huge asset to be able to move it right back.

###Changing with the Game

In the beginning, everyone wants to build roads and settlments and that means lumber and that sweet brick are in high demand. However, later in the game when the board is locked up to focus shifts to cities and Dev Cards in the form of wheat and ore. It is helpful to observe this change.

#Styles of Play

In my mind, there are a few roles you can play in the game that give you a good chance of winning. If you solidify yourself as this player early, players will not contest you for it.

###Development Card Guy

"Dev Cards" can change a game in the blink of an eye. From moving to robber to straight up winning the game. If you establish yourself as the guy whose gonna go for Dev Cards first, you most likely will pick up **biggest army** and a few **Victory Points** aswell. A great asset of this strategy is your ability to conceal your Dev Cards and pull of some game changing suprises. 

###Longest Road Guy

You want to expand your kingdom to the reaches of the earth and that's cool. While this strategy can be costly resource wise, you can set your self up for a great second half of the game. Having an extremely long road not only gives you the two pointes for longest road but it gives you a lot of space for settlments which can give you access to precious resources you had to barter for in the beginning. 

###Port Trading Guy

With a high frequency resource next to a 2:1 port of the corresponding type, you can build quite the trade post enabling you to get a diverse array of resources early in the game.
