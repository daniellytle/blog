The following are my half-serious methods of finding a more meaningfull and personal social media experience. Every social media platform is different and has a specific use which contributed to its rise to power. I'll cover what I consider the power five in social media and the type of content that they are best suited for.

##Snapchat

**Content** - Snapchat is best for when you know something moderately interesting is going to happen. Crazy enough that you want to record it but not crazy enough to save for later. 

**Example** - People near you are arguing, time to take a snapchat or your facial expressions while overhearing their passionate discussion.

**Etiquette** - Awkward conversations or "Snap Coversations" 

##Vine



##Instagram



##Twitter

##Facebook
