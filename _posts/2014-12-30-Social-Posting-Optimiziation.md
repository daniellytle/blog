The following are my half-serious methods of finding a more meaningful and personal social media experience. Every social media platform is different and has a specific use which contributed to its rise to power. I'll cover what I consider the power four in social media and the type of content that they are best suited for.

##Snapchat

**Content** - Snapchat is best for when you know something moderately interesting is going to happen. Crazy enough that you want to record it but not crazy enough to save for later. 

**Etiquette** - Never get caught taking a snap. You will be called out. Also, awkward conversations or "Snap Conversations" consisting of pictures of your face or other stuff around you can occur. These are difficult to end without feeling slightly responsible. 

##Instagram

**Content** - Colorful pictures of the most beautiful things in your life including food of any kind

**Etiquette** - The worst thing you can do in the instagram world is post twice in succession, it is a truly hainus act that referred to as the "Double Insta" a felony in many social circles. You should also limit your output to 1/day. Make sure to include many hashtages embedded in your caption to link your post to other needless pictures.

##Twitter

**Content** - Witty one liners that show who you are and that you are very cool.

**Etiquette** - Respect the Retweet. While it is a great way to find new content, it can make or break your reputation and relationship with users, retweet responsibly.

##Facebook

**Content** - Pseudo press releases about major life decisions you have made

**Etiquette** - Just because you like it doesn't mean you have to "Like it". This has led to innocent users feeds becoming flooded with the fluff content that makes facebook so bloated.
