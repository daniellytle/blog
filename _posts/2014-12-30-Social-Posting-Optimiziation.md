The following are my half-serious methods of finding a more meaningfull and personal social media experience. Every social media platform is different and has a specific use which contributed to its rise to power. I'll cover what I consider the power five in social media and the type of content that they are best suited for.

##Snapchat

**Content** - Snapchat is best for when you know something moderately interesting is going to happen. Crazy enough that you want to record it but not crazy enough to save for later. 

**Example** - People near you are arguing, time to take a snapchat or your facial expressions while overhearing their passionate discussion.

**Etiquette** - Never get caught taking a snap. You will be called out. Also, awkward conversations or "Snap Coversations" consisting of pictures of your face or other stuff around you can occur. These are difficult to end without feeling slightly responsible.
