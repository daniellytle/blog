title: Building a Multi-Room Chatroom with Socket.io and Node
---

In this tutorial we will build a multi-room chatroom that also implements unique users leaving and connecting using Socket.io. To achieve this we will keep track of our connected users and their respected websocket on our server.
          
``` javascript
    funtion(var) {
          console.log("hey");
    }
```

Here we create the socket on the server.
