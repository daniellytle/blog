title: Building a Multi-Room Chatroom with Socket.io and Node
---

In this tutorial we will build a multi-room chatroom that also implements unique users leaving and connecting using Socket.io. To achieve this we will keep track of our connected users and their respected websocket on our server.

Test Test

```javascript
io.sockets.on('connection', function (socket) {

        socketList.push(socket);

        io.emit('new',socketList.length);

        socket.on('joinGroup', function (info) {
            var i = socketList.indexOf(socket);
            socketList[i].roomName = info.roomName;
            socketList[i].userName = info.userName;
            socket.join(info.roomName);

            data[info.roomName].users.push({
                name:info.userName,
                socketIndex: i,
                songTitle:"",
                songURL:null,
                songLink:""
                });

            socket.emit('joined',{});

            socket.broadcast.to(info.roomName).emit('roomChange',info.userName + " Joined the Party!");

        });
```

Here we create the socket on the server.
