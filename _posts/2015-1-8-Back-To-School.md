**It's that time of year again**, where we all must return to our studies, this time braving sub-zero temperatures and classes that always seem harder than last semesters. That being said it's also an opportunity to push forward into new experiences that you never thought were possible. 

The semester currently facing me is sure to be a good time. All my professors are very engaging and animate.
