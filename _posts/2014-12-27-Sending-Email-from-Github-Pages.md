title: Sending Emails from Github Pages
---

As I was setting up my personal website with Github Pages (which is awesome), I ran into the issue of creating a contact form that I could receive emails from.

Before, I used a service set up by umich, but it became a bit hard to work with. After searching far and wide, I came across this. An awesome blog post about formspree.io.
