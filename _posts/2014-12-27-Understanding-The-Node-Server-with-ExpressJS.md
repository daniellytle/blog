In this post we will build and review a simple Node.js server using ExpressJS. When I first began working with Node.js, I was amazed by how simple it was but I still didn't fully understand what was going. In this post, we will go over each line.

##Prerequisites

You will need to have Node and npm installed in order to load ExpressJS and run our server locally.

First we use **npm** to load our node dependancies **Express.js** and **Socket.io**. Run these commands in your working directory to do so.

```
$ npm install socket.io --save
$ npm install express --save
```

**install** will find the package by name and save it to your node dependencies in the directory **/node_modules**. The **--save** option saves the package to your dependencies. There are other options for saving to enhance your workflow, check out the [npm install documention](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install).

##The Server

Lets create our Node.js server in a file called **server.js**. This is the same file used in the [ExpressJS API Docs](http://expressjs.com/api.html).

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var app 	= express();

app.listen(8080);
```

This is all you need to start your Node server, but let's go a little deeper on what's going on here.

**Reqiure**, from a high level, is used to load Node libraries and modules. In the first line we are loading the **ExpressJS** Module into a the variable **express**.

The next line, running **express()** returns a JS function that is passed to Node's HTTP servers as a callback to handle requests. This enables you to write functions for api routes using our **app** variable.

The last line simply binds the object to your current host and port specified. Here we are listening for requests on **Port 8080**.

#API Routes

Lets add some routes to our server.js file and give our server some purpose. Add the following lines to the bottom of **server.js**.

```
app.get('*', function(req, res) {
	res.send('Hello World');
});
```

This route will catch any **GET Request** to our host on port 8080 and send back the text **"Hello World"**. 

Now point your browser to localhost:8080 were our server is listening. You should be greated with our prepared message.

That's cool but lets bump it up a notch. Create a file called **index.html** that we will send to clients rather than just simple text.

```html
<body>
    <h1>Hello Folks</h1>
</body>
```
